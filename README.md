# Tic-Tac-Toe-bevy ðŸ¦€ðŸ¤–
This project is to help familiarize myself with [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) by using an existing [Tic-Tac-Toe game](https://github.com/LightHardt/Tic-Tac-Toe). The beginning of this code was from an example provided by bevy that I have now slowly morphed into what I need.
